1. Create a function that prints the fibonacci sequence
2. Create a nested function where you can demonstrate the scope of variables.

For example:

func 1 (params 1):
	some actions
	func 2 (params 2):
		some actions with params 1 and params 2
		func 3 (params 3):
			some actions with all the variables

Are those actions with shared parameters going to work?
